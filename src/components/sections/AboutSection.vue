            CelestialSim is a <strong>free and open source</strong> tool designed for Godot that enables
            rapid procedural terrain
            generation and simulation. Built by developers for developers, it leverages dynamic
            Level-of-Detail (LOD) to
            ensure smooth, real-time rendering even for complex planetary environments.
          </p>
          <p>
            What sets CelestialSim apart is its <strong>AI-first architecture</strong> and open
            source community. The tool creates
            embedding-compatible representations of generated worlds, making it seamlessly integrate
            with AI models for
            intelligent exploration and content discovery. This opens up exciting possibilities for
            automated
            terrain analysis, point-of-interest detection, and AI-assisted world building.
          </p>

            Whether you're developing expansive open-world games or need dynamic terrain for simulation
            purposes, CelestialSim provides the foundation for creating immersive, procedurally
            generated
            environments with cutting-edge performance and AI integration capabilities. <strong>Join our
              growing
              community of contributors and help shape the future of procedural generation!</strong>
